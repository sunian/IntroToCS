## Solar System Simulation ##
I have created a new module in this project called SolarSystem. If you click Update Project (the blue arrow), you should be able to see the classes I created. These classes are mostly empty and you should try to fill some of them in. You will also need to create some of your own classes to complete this simulation.  
Here is what the simulation should consist of:  
A solar system: this contains many celestial bodies, such as stars, planets, and moons.  
All celestial bodies should have a name, a mass, and a location in space.  
All planets must belong to a star. All moons must belong to a planet.  
Some celestial bodies are fluid (such as the Sun and the planet Jupiter), and some are solid (such as the Earth and the Moon).  
Celestial bodies can collide with one another. When that happens, fluid bodies will merge together, but solid bodies will bounce away from each other.  
If this is confusing at first, please look at the code I have set up for you to help you get started. Read the comments I wrote in each class for more detailed information. Remember, there is more than one way to code up this simulation, so don't be afraid to just try something. If it doesn't work at first, you can always fix it later.   
If you have any other questions, let me know.
